# Guidelines

We believe that peoples suggestions and bug reports are extremely valuable to help improve the mod, hence this respository and the fact that people can send their feedback directly to us developers. However, we get *a lot* of suggestions/bug reports and it takes time going through all them, especially when people send duplicate issues or make invalid ones. These guidelines are here to help minimize the time wasted from closing duplicates, and to ensure your issues are formatted well and won't be invalid.

**Please read this in its entirely!**

Please, do not open issues to ask questions or for assistance. That is far better suited for the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cracker-s-modded-community-987817685293355028), or in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/discussions).

## Suggestions/Feature Requests:

We get a lot of suggestions, and we cannot implement them all. Some we close if it doesn’t fit the vision of the mod, difficulty of implementing, and if it is even worth implementing. These guidelines help limit time wasted closing duplicate suggestions, etc. 
**Please go through this before you make a feature suggestion.**

### Commonly requested features:

***NOTE: These are NOT all of the suggestions. Make sure to check the issues tab (by either scrolling through them or searching for key words) to see if yours also already been submitted.***

***Do NOT suggest your idea if it relates to:***
- Making the mod more “accurate” to Minecraft: Story Mode (don’t request specific features such as characters, items, or mechanics from the game)
- Making drastic model changes 
- Texture changes (unless if it’s to fix inconsistencies or genuine mistakes with the texture). Texture changes are far better suited for resource packs
- Drastic progression changes. Most progression changes would fit best in a custom modpack. *Feel free to suggest configuration options/commands that would help/allow you to pull off your idea*
- April fools ideas/easter eggs and/or features that would appear on specific holidays. These would be added on our own discretion and are kept as secrets until you see them appear in the mod
- New tools/armor sets (we've seen command block armor plenty of times already)
- Features that haven't been released yet but have been showcased. You don't need to suggest what's already coming
- More sickened mobs (they will be added as they are added)
- Tainted variants of existing blocks/items (we will add more on our own discretion)

## Bug reports:

Before opening a bug report, make sure it’s not already been reported and/or fixed. Make sure to submit clear steps to reproduce the issue if you know how to cause it.

Make sure to supply your mod list **if you have more mods installed other than Cracker's Wither Storm Mod.**

If the bug is due to the game crashing, provide the crash report! If you don't your issue will be closed, and you will have to resubmit it.
You can find crash reports in `.minecraft/crash-reports`

**If you’re facing an issue, check the [Known Compatibility Issues](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Known-Compatibility-Issues) page before reporting here as it may have a fix.**
